        <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
        I'm Eduard - Front-end developer from Lviv.
I'm interested in web-development and everything connected with it.
Earlier, I graduated from university with a degree in "Computer engineering
". I can safely say that all my conscious life is connected with IT.

<h1>GOAL</h1>
I want to be in a good team, where I could improve my skills and use them to interesting tasks. I'd like to work on HTMl layout and JS development. But, I think, for this, I need a good team lead, who could show me the best practices of work.

<h1>INTERESTS</h1>
I spend most of my free time studying. I also like to watch movies and TV series, and now I'm play the piano.
